_An easy-to-use tool to forecast prescriptions for any PBS listed drug in Australia_

__Published 07.Aug.2023__

Forecasting is complex. It is, usually, left to external consultants, seasoned analysts or those who are skilled in statistical tools and techniques. Forecasting models thus developed are difficult to explain to business leaders. On top of this, they break down all the time, leading to maintenance headaches.

This tool helps business managers, product managers and analysts from the pharmaceutical industry visualize and analyze past and future prescription trends of any PBS listed drug in Australia. It offers a quick way to challenge existing internal forecasts about product and market growth. 

While the data as well as the forecasting techniques used in this tool have been available for a long time, few organizations make good use of either. 

“This tool makes it so easy for me to assess how my drug has been performing vis-a-vis the market for free.” 
“I have been able to use this tool to adjust and explain my forecasts when presenting to business leaders. I do not need to know Excel or any fancy software to use this."
